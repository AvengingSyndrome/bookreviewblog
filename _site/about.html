            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I’m Andrew. You can find my resume/projects I’m working on at <a href="http://ndrewsemler.com">ndrewsemler.com</a></p>
<p>My rating system is either positive or nothing. You should hopefully pick up how I enjoyed the book without needing a score out of 5. Also consider how uber requires you to give anyone decent a 4 or 5 star rating. This makes the rating almost useless. Embrace this uselessness. A positive rating means you should consider buying it or reading a sample. Nothing means it’s up to you.</p>
<p>The thing I enjoy most when reading is being made to feel something. It doesn’t particularly matter what the feeling is as long as it’s strong. If that’s amazement at a character’s skill or horror at the situation then so much the better.</p>
