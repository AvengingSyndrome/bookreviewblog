<p>This is a sci-fi anime produced by Netflix. The show opens with the discovery by Kei that he’s an Ajin. Ajin are vertually indistinguishable from humans, even to themselves. They are revealed in death. Ajin’s can’t die and will come back to life. There are 47 Ajins worldwide who are kept in captivity. They’re also experimented on by the government. Kei knows this and after his publice death, begins his escape. Will the pursuit of Kei start a fight for something much bigger than his freedom?</p>
<p>The thing I liked the most was that there are no heroes in this show. No-one can claim a moral victory. You were therefore free to enjoy</p>
