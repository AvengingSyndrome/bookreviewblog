<p>This is a sci-fi anime produced by Netflix. The show opens with the discovery by Kei that he’s an Ajin. Ajin are virtually indistinguishable from humans, even to themselves. They are revealed in death. Ajins can’t die and will come back to life.</p>
<p>There are 47 Ajins worldwide who are kept in captivity. They’re also experimented on by the government. Kei knows this and after his public death, begins his escape. Will the pursuit of Kei start a fight for something much bigger than his freedom?</p>
<p>The thing I liked the most was that there are no heroes in this show. No-one can claim a moral victory. This let you enjoy the story as people tried their best to further their own goals. The strategies that were on offer from the characters evolved. Ajin fighting had many stages. The first is to use tranquillisers. The Ajin counter to tranquillisers is to kill themselves.</p>
<p>“If you don’t succeed we will remove you from your position” - The most frustrating part of a shadowy cabal. Why does this happen in every single show/book which features this? The cabal has clearly put them in power for merit. Maybe they’re facing a particularly good opponent? In a surprising departure from the norm the target performs better! Note that better doesn’t mean meaner. They actually come up with a novel plan.</p>
<p>A very fun and slightly bloody show. It is available on Netflix.</p>
