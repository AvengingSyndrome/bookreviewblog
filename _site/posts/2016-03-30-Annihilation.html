<p><img src="../images/annihilation.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width:200px;" /> This is a seriously creepy sci-fi post apocalypse novel that follows a biologist on expedition into Area X. I tend to find that horror (though I can’t pretend to be familiar with the genre) hides information seemingly at random and often has characters holding the idiot ball. This tends to make the genre irritating rather than scary. I’m pleased to say Annihilation didn’t do that. The biologist picked up information and shared it with the reader and wasn’t a complete idiot. The problem for the biologist was that the information didn’t really help. The novel perfectly captured the feeling of a false explanation.</p>
<p>The general creepy-ness factor of this goes up as you learn that unlike most post apocalypse stories most people aren’t actually aware they’re in one. A sense of inevitability follows you as you read this. You know nothing good is going to happen but you’re not going to stop reading. When I lent this book to a friend they read it in a single weekend which shows how consuming the novel is.</p>
<p>Maybe the speed at which I read this caused me to miss a lot of the twists but they felt non-obvious and the sinking feeling you get as you experience the horror is truly excellent. I found parts of the ending a little weird (which is to be expected to be honest) but it was strange in a different direction to the rest of the novel. However the ending felt satisfying for several reasons. You arrived at the end not knowing too much so there was a feeling of anti-climax which fit with the feeling generated by the rest of the novel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Can you really imagine what it was like in those first moments, peering down into that dark space, and <em>seeing that</em>? Perhaps you can. Perhaps you’re staring at it now”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first novel in a trilogy. Even though I loved the feeling as I read this novel I’m not certain I want to read the second. This was mainly due to arriving at the end with the amount of information you did. Not enough to ruin the ending but far too much to see where a sequel would go. However the second novel is apparently set in a different part of the Annihilation Universe so I am tempted.</p>
<p>I got a physical copy but there is also a kindle version which means you can find a small preview on Amazon</p>
