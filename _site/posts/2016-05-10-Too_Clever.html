<p>3 wakes up in a hospital bed with no memory of who he is or why he’s here. Does 3 overcome the temptation of reading a document marked “Don’t read, this is not a joke” or does he follow his curiosty?</p>

<p>“But I can’t tell you, and I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you.” “Can you tell me… why you can’t tell me why you can’t tell me?” She sighed in exasperation. “No, and it goes all the way down. Trust me.”</p>
