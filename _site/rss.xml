    <title>The Traitor Baru Comorant - Seth Dickinson</title>
    <link>http://ndrewsemler.com/reviews/posts/2016-03-30-The_Traitor_Baru_Comorant.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[This book is set in an alternate past where the Masquerade is an empire that is achieving conquest through economics rather than through the strength of their Navy or Calvary. Appropriately the main character(Baru) is a bright accountant. I read this over the past two days when I should have been sleeping and found it about as stressful to read as Argo was to watch. Multiple crowning moments of awesome which were tempered by the disgust I felt throughout the whole novel.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This is a seriously creepy sci-fi post apocalypse novel that follows a biologist on expedition into Area X. Her expedition runs into the tower. A mysterious living structure embedded into the ground. Who is producing the writing on the wall? Why does it seem alive?]]></description>
