<p>I read reasonably frequently and tend to like to talk about the books I've read. If you find a review here of a book you've enjoyed please feel free to geek out with me about it. These book reviews will probably be short but should give you info about the genre and what I felt about the novel. Hopefully enough to convince you to read a sample anyway. There is a high probability the book will be sci-fi or fantasy.</p>

<p>I've reproduced a list of recent reviews here for your reading pleasure:</p>
